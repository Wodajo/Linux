`/etc/apt/sources.list` - default list of apt repos
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` - you can create `.list` files with repos here also

add repo to `.list` file in `etc/apt/` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`
```
# this is how an enty should look
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security universe
```

`wget -qO - https://deb.ubuntu.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -`
	`-q` quiet
	`-O -` output to stdout (great for scripting)
	`add` add new to key to list of trusted keys. Normally it reads file, but `add -` read ftom `stdin`

`apt-key list` list trusted keys
`sudo apt update`

### using PPA
personal package archive - Debian software repository allowing installing software not included in official repos
	- not that secure
	- slighty easier to setup

it works by adding new software repository (new entry in`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` -> downloading public key -> updating local repo

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:<ppa_name>`
