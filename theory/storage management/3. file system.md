controls how data is stored and retrieved

`journaling` - logging changes before committed to fs -> can **automatically** rapair the folders/files on disk using info stored in a log

`Copy-on-write` fs (like `btrfs` and `ZFS`) have NO need to use traditional journal to protect metadata, because they are never updated in-place
`btrfs` still has a journal-like log tree, but it's only used to speed-up `fdatasync/fsync`

### creating fs
you need an empty partition
`lsblk` - list block devices (partitions)
`mkfs` + tab -> see what it can suggest:D
e.g. `mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb1`
`lsblk -f` - to see block devices fs

### common fs types
- btrfs 
	- modern copy-on-write (CoW) filesystem for Linux
	- not really stable
- ext4
	- most common
	- stable
	- journaling
- XFS - high-performance fs
	- CentOS & RHEL
	- has it's own set of tools
- ZFS - owned by Oracle
	- pooled storage (integrated volume management â€“ zpool)
	- [Copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write "wikipedia:Copy-on-write")  [snapshots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_(computer_storage) "wikipedia:Snapshot (computer storage)")
	- data integrity verification and automatic repair (scrubbing)
	- [RAID-Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID-Z "wikipedia:RAID-Z")
	- a maximum [16 exabyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte "wikipedia:Exabyte") file size, and a maximum 256 quadrillion [zettabyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte "wikipedia:Zettabyte") storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files
- FAT - family of fs supported by nearly all systems - good for data exchange
	- `mkfs.fat` supports creating FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32
- NILFS2 - raw flash devices, e.g. SD card
- NTFS - Microsoft fs


### ext4 hierarchy
local hard drive (/dev/sda1)
	- root (`/`) partition
		- virtual fs
		  (e.g. `/proc/` & `/sys/` are dynamically created fs serving as a way to interact with the kernel)
		- remote fs
		  (e.g. `/home/` mounted via `NFS` or `SMB`)
		- USB drive
		  (e.g. mounted in `/media/usb1`)
		- second drive
		  (e.g. `/dev/sdb2` mounted in `/mnt/data`)
		- files/dirs
