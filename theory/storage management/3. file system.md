controls how data is stored and retrieved

`journaling` - logging changes before committed to fs -> can **automatically** rapair the folders/files on disk using info stored in a log

`Copy-on-write` fs (like `btrfs` and `ZFS`) have NO need to use traditional journal to protect metadata, because they are never updated in-place
`btrfs` still has a journal-like log tree, but it's only used to speed-up `fdatasync/fsync`

### creating fs
you need an empty partition
`lsblk` - list block devices (partitions)
`mkfs` + tab -> see what it can suggest:D
e.g. `mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb1`
`lsblk -f` - to see block devices fs


### scanning fs
`fsck` (file system consistency check) - check the integrity of fs & can automatically repair errors
Scanning takes time. You might not want ot scan very big fs often

##### automatically, ext4
in `/etc/fstab` there is option `<pass>`
if `<pass>`:
	0 - never run `fsck` 
	1 - first fs to `fsck` (it should always be `root partition`)
	2 -  all secondary partitions
BUT so as to run it:
	- the partition has to be unmounted
		- `root partition` should be checked at boot (or from live-iso)
		- not a problem with secondary&tertiary drive mounts
	- if the `mount count` < `max. mount count` - it won't scan
		- with each mounting of a fs `mount count` += 1
		- by default `max. mount count` == -1 -> it will NEVER autoscan at boot

`tune2fs -l /dev/sda1` - list partition related info, i.a. `max. mount count`
`tune2fs -c 10 /dev/sda1` - set `max. mount count` to 10

when `/etc/fstab` wants to run `fsck` && `mount count` == `max. mount count` -> `fsck
-> `mount count` = 0

##### manually
I think it's easiest to:
`tune2fs -c 1 -C 2 /dev/sda1` -> `reboot` -> `tune2fs -c -1 /dev/sda1`
`-c` - `max. mounts count`
`-C` - `mount count`

or from live-iso:
`fsck /dev/sda1`

### common fs types
- btrfs 
	- modern copy-on-write (CoW) filesystem for Linux
	- not really stable
- ext4
	- most common
	- stable
	- journaling
- XFS - high-performance fs
	- CentOS & RHEL
	- has it's own set of tools
- ZFS - owned by Oracle
	- pooled storage (integrated volume management â€“ zpool)
	- [Copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write "wikipedia:Copy-on-write")  [snapshots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_(computer_storage) "wikipedia:Snapshot (computer storage)")
	- data integrity verification and automatic repair (scrubbing)
	- [RAID-Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID-Z "wikipedia:RAID-Z")
	- a maximum [16 exabyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte "wikipedia:Exabyte") file size, and a maximum 256 quadrillion [zettabyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte "wikipedia:Zettabyte") storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files
- FAT - family of fs supported by nearly all systems - good for data exchange
	- `mkfs.fat` supports creating FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32
- NILFS2 - raw flash devices, e.g. SD card
- NTFS - Microsoft fs


### ext4 hierarchy
local hard drive (/dev/sda1)
	- root (`/`) partition
		- virtual fs
		  (e.g. `/proc/` & `/sys/` are dynamically created fs serving as a way to interact with the kernel)
		- remote fs
		  (e.g. `/home/` mounted via `NFS` or `SMB`)
		- USB drive
		  (e.g. mounted in `/media/usb1`)
		- second drive
		  (e.g. `/dev/sdb2` mounted in `/mnt/data`)
		- files/dirs
