creating more regions on `secondary storage`, so that each region can be managed separately


`lsblk` - list block devices
`/proc/partitions` - same as `lsblk` but less readible
(`/proc` is a virtual fs for interactions with the kernel)


`fdisk` - create&manipulate `partition table`&partitions (standard linux tool)
`parted` - as above
`gpparted` - GUI frontend of `parted`
