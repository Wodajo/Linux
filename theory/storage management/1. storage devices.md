`block device` - storage device writting&reading data in blocks of fixed size (typically 512 bytes)
	- efficient random access to the data bcos OS can quickly locate and retrieve specific blocks of data
	e.g. HDD, SSD, flash drives
		How `block size` affect performance:
			- disk I/O: `large block` -> read/write in `fewer operations` BUT can lead to `wasted space` when small files
			- `large block` -> fewer block used to store a file -> `reduced nr. of disk seeks` to access it
			- `large block` -> fewer blocks to manage -> less fs overhead -> `reduced memory&processing` power to manage fs
			- `larger block` -> more memory needed to store `system's block map` -> can reduce performance if not enough memory
			generally `performance-storage trade-off`
`character device` - storage device writting&reading data one character at a time
	- OS communicates directly with `device driver` -> low-level and direct control over the device
	(without the use of a `buffer cache` like in `block device`s)
	e.g. serial port


`primary storage` - accessed directly by CPU
	- CPU registers
	- CPU cache memory
	- RAM (connected with CPU via `memory bus`)

`secondary storage` - not directly accessable by CPU
connected with `primary storage` via `I/O channels`

`tertiary storage` - refers to storage mainly used for archiving data
