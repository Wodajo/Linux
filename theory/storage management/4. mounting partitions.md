`mounting point` must be an empty dir

#### mount
`lsblk -f` - to view partitions with fs
`mount -t ext4 /dev/usb1 /usb1`
	`-t` - to pass fs type (mount usually figures-out fs type, but if you know why not)
`mount` - list where what is mounted
`df -h` - list fs with files

#### unmount
`umount /usb1`

### mount at boot
`/etc/fstab` - partitions here are mounted at boot or if you use `mount -a`
```
<file system>    <mount point>    <type>    <options>    <dump>    <pass>
/dev/sda1       /       ext4    defaults,errors=remount-ro      0       1
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/10gig ext4 defaults 0 
/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0
```
`<file system>` - you can specify fs by UUID (`lsblk -f` or `blkid`), device (like `/dev/sdb1`) or even a label
`<dump>` - depreciated, put 0
`<pass>`
	0 - never run `fsck` (file system consistency check)
	1 - first fs to `fsck` (it should always be `root partition`)
	2 -  all secondary partitions
`fsck` - check the integrity of fs & can automatically repair errors
BUT so as to run it:
	- the partition has to be unmounted
		- `root partition` should be checked at boot (or from live-iso)
		- not a problem with secondary&tertiary drive mounts
	- if the `mount count` != `max. mount count` - it won't scan
		- with each mounting of a fs `mount count` += 1
		- by default `max. mount count` == -1 -> it will NEVER autoscan at boot

`tune2fs -l /dev/sda1` - list partition related info, i.a. `max. mount count`
`tune2fs -c 10 /dev/sda1` - set `max. mount count` to 10


when `/etc/fstab` wants to run `fsck` && `mount count` == `max. mount count` -> `fsck`
