`mounting point` must be an empty dir

#### mount
`lsblk -f` - to view partitions with fs
`mount -t ext4 /dev/usb1 /usb1`
	`-t` - to pass fs type (mount usually figures-out fs type, but if you know why not)
`mount` - list where what is mounted

#### unmount
`umount /usb1`

### mount at boot
`/etc/fstab` - mounted at boot & if you use `mount -a`
```
<file system>    <mount point>    <type>    <options>    <dump>    <pass>
/dev/sda1       /       ext4    defaults,errors=remount-ro      0       1
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/10gig ext4 defaults 0 
/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0
```
`<file system>` - you can specify fs by UUID (`lsblk -f` or `blkid`), device (like `/dev/sdb1`) or even a label
`<dump>` - depreciated, put 0
`<pass>`
	0 - never run fs check
	1 - first fs to check (it should always be root partition)
	2 -  all secondary partitions
