BIOS/UEFI -> GRUB/GRUB2 -> kernel -> init (systemd) -> rest of system processes


`GPT` (GUID partition table) & `MBR` (Master Boot Record) - disk partitioning schemes used to organize data on a storage device ("table of contents", "how disk is chopped")

`MBR` - use 1 primary partition containing bootloader
- `max. disk size` = 2TB
- support only 4 `primary partitions` OR 3 `primary` and 1 `extended partition`
- compatible with `BIOS`

`GPT`
- `max. disk size` > 2TB
- support 128 partitions
- include backup copy of `partition table` at the end of a disk
  (partition data can be recovered in case of corruption)
- does CRC corrections
- GUID (globally unique identifier) for each disk and partition
  (good filesystem-independent way of referencing partitions and disks)
- compatible with `UEFI` (practically part of `UEFI`) and `BIOS`
  (contain `protective MBR` at the beggining telling `BIOS` there is a drive there. It probably will require some tampering)
