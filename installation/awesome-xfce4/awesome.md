`sudo apt install awesome awesome-extra rofi nitrogen picom unlcutter xbacklight xsel slock`
	`unclutter` hides mouse when not needed

get `.conifg/awesome/rc.lua` and other stuff (for theming) 

might get used later:
	`amixer dmenu librewolf mpc mpd scrot unclutter xbacklight xsel slock`
		`mpd` - music player daemon
		`mpc` - cli of `mpd`
