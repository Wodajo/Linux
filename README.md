# Linux-projects
Projects aiming for better linux-kernel OSs understandment and/or linux related fun.  

Plans:  
Arch installation -> audio and network managers  (Base for later configuratons - maybe even write installing script?)  

-> qtile Windows Manager (for fast and extravagant work environment)  
-> kernel switching and modules (seems like a pretty damn important thing)  
-> KVM/QEMU/libvirt/virt-manager (as a part of hypervisors quelling)

-> list important applications (for future installing script of full/task-oriented work environment)
