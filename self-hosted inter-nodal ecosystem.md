How I'd like it to work?
How can I make it work?

#### Nextcloud
works for Android, Lin, Win, Mac
-   ~~Mail~~ - I prefere protonmail
-   ~~Calendar~~c - pcalendar
-   Files sync
-   Contacts

-   Tasks
  
###### Hosted on local server
access via port forwarding / proxy

Pros:
truly self-hosted
probably cheaper in long run

Cons:
router-stability dependant
harder to set up

##### Hosted on rented server
easy access

Pros:
easy set up
cheaper in short term
less prone to local errors (like power outage)

Cons:
not really self-hosted
subscriber-like paymentship
